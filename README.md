🌟 SD FaceFusion for Automatic1111 (by RunDiffusion)
==========

> Extension of the upstream FaceFusion project tailored for Automatic1111. Adds YOLO-driven auto-padding masks, extra processors, integrated tabs and postprocessing, and model/output paths aligned with Automatic1111.

🔥 What’s different from upstream
--------
- **Automatic1111 integration**: Adds a dedicated "RD FaceFusion" tab and an optional postprocessing step in txt2img/img2img. Uses Automatic1111 `models` and output paths.
- **YOLO Auto Padding (custom masking)**:
  - Select any Ultralytics YOLO model to detect objects that intersect with or are near faces and automatically apply padding around the face crop.
  - Works with `.pt` models placed in `models/adetailer` (preferred). If a mask is available, it’s used; otherwise bounding boxes are converted to masks. Configurable confidence and intersection threshold.
  - Replaces the old "custom" mask type with a more robust, detection-driven workflow. Manual on/off markers are still available when Auto Padding is off.
- **Additional/extended processors**: Ships face processors like `Face Swapper`, `Face Enhancer` (with smart enhance), `Expression Restorer` (LivePortrait-based options), `Face Editor`, `Face Debugger`, `Lip Syncer`, `Style Changer`, `Style Transfer`, `Frame Enhancer`, `Frame Colorizer` and more under `facefusion/processors/classes`.
- **Enhanced face detection options**: Adds `yoloface` (default) and `yunet` in addition to upstream detectors.
- **Job system and live previews**: Queue jobs, multi-step processing, and preview frames while processing.
- **Model/download alignment**: Auto-downloads models into paths consistent with Automatic1111; leverages onnxruntime-gpu and caches YOLO models in-process for performance.


🧩 Automatic1111 integration
--------
- Tab: Appears as "RD FaceFusion" with File/Live/Benchmark layouts.
- Postprocessing: Optional checkbox to run FaceFusion after generation and swap/enhance using provided source faces.
- Outputs: Written to Automatic1111 temp/output dirs; model paths resolve via `modules.paths_internal.models_path`.


🎯 YOLO Auto Padding (custom object-aware masking)
--------
- UI: In Masking options, select a model in "Auto Padding Model". When a model is selected:
  - "Detection Confidence" (0–1) and "Intersection Threshold (px)" appear.
  - Manual mask timing buttons are hidden (you can re-enable by setting model to "None").
- Models: Place `.pt` files in `models/adetailer/`. The dropdown lists available files from there.
- Behavior: The worker detects objects, filters by confidence, and checks intersection/proximity to each face. If intersecting/near, padding is applied to the crop. Processors (e.g., Swapper/Enhancer/Expression Restorer) consume the recommended padding automatically.
- Notes:
  - We cache YOLO models and suppress Ultralytics logs to keep the UI responsive.
  - Legacy "custom mask" is deprecated in favor of Auto Padding.


🎨 Style processors
--------
- **Style Changer** (face-aware ONNX, per-face + background)
  - Models: dual ONNX models per style (head/background) auto-downloaded to `extensions/sd_facefusion/facefusion/.assets/models/style/`.
    - Available styles include: `anime`, `3d`, `handdrawn`, `sketch`, `artstyle`, `design`, `illustration`.
  - Options: "Selected Style", "Style Target" (`source` or `target`), and "Skip Head" when applying to target.
  - Behavior: detects faces, warps/crops the head region, stylizes head and/or background, and blends using an internal alpha mask.
  - Performance: runs via onnxruntime; GPU providers recommended for speed.

- **Style Transfer** (global neural style transfer, PyTorch)
  - Model: `style_net-TIP-final.pth` auto-downloaded to `extensions/sd_facefusion/facefusion/.assets/models/style/`.
  - Inputs: one or more style images (UI: provide style images; multiple are averaged by default). Works on images and video frames.
  - Behavior: performs sequence-level global feature sharing for video (samples frames at intervals, precomputes norms) to keep style consistent across frames.
  - Performance: CUDA recommended. CPU works but is slower.

UI notes:
- Enable the processors under "Processors". Style Changer options appear in the left panel; Style Transfer options appear near the Source panel (right column) with style image inputs.
- `Style Transfer` is a non-face processor (applies to the whole frame). `Style Changer` is face-aware and participates in face masking options.


🧠 Processors available (high level)
--------
- **Face Swapper**: Primary swapping module with optional Pixel Boost.
- **Face Enhancer**: `gfpgan_1.4` etc., with Smart Enhance controls and minimum-size thresholds.
- **Expression Restorer**: LivePortrait-based expression constraints/limits.
- **Face Editor / Debugger**: Fine-grained attribute controls and visual debugging overlays.
- **Lip Syncer**: Audio-driven lip movement.
- **Style Changer / Style Transfer**, **Frame Enhancer / Frame Colorizer**.

You can enable/disable processors and their options in the UI; arguments are also available via our program interface.


🧭 Differences vs upstream at a glance
--------
- Integrated into Automatic1111 (UI tabs and postprocessing APIs) rather than a standalone app only.
- YOLO-driven Auto Padding pipeline replaces upstream custom mask type and is wired into face selection and processors.
- Uses Automatic1111 model/output paths and supports YOLO models from `models/adetailer`.
- Expanded detectors (`yoloface`, `yunet`) and default detector set to `yoloface`.
- Caching and runtime handling for Ultralytics models; quieter logs; onnxruntime-gpu ensured.
- Some upstream CLI commands still exist, but the typical flow is via the Automatic1111 UI.

🛠 Installation
--------
- Install this extension by URL in Automatic1111 like any other extension.
- First run auto-installs requirements and onnxruntime-gpu; torchaudio is installed to match your Torch/CUDA build.
- For YouTube URLs, this fork uses `yt-dlp` (no manual `pytube` patching required).


📁 Model paths
--------
- FaceFusion models are auto-downloaded on demand to the extension’s model folders.
- YOLO models for Auto Padding: drop `.pt` files into `models/adetailer/`.


⚙️ Configuration tips
--------
- `face_detector_model`: default `yoloface`.
- Auto Padding state keys: `auto_padding_model`, `auto_padding_confidence` (default 0.5), `auto_padding_intersection_threshold` (default 50 px).
- Manual mask timing remains available when Auto Padding is disabled (Enable/Disable/Clear markers per frame).
